You can find my project on https://danse-skole.web.app/. Responsive on phone7/ 8 pluss. Other versions are in building.

This project was bootstrapped with Create React App. You have to install node and npm to start this project.

npm install

Youâ€™ll need to have Node >= 10 on your local development machine.

npm is distributed with Node.js- which means that when you download Node.js, you automatically get npm installed on your computer. https://nodejs.org/en/

You have to make your own database key as well.

In the project directory, you can run:

npm start
